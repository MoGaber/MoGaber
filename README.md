### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a physicist and data scientist. I have a passion for applying machine learning and data science to solving real life problems in other fields like physics. I have worked at several research centers world wide where I contributed to developing models and building simulations of physical systems.  

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a full-stack simulation of granular materials using neural networks
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Learning Engineering and the application of machine learning and data science to education through my fellowship at UC Berkeley
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ambitious projects at the interface of data science and physics
