### Hi there 👋

<!--
**MoGaber/MoGaber** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a physicist and data scientist. I have a passion for applying machine learning and data science to solving real life problems in other fields like physics. I have worked at several research centers world wide where I contributed to developing models and building simulations of physical systems.  

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing a full-stack simulation of granular materials using neural networks
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Learning Engineering and the application of machine learning and data science to education through my fellowship at UC Berkeley
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ambitious projects at the interface of data science and physics
